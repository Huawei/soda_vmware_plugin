    5) The SRA is a software product that enables a storage system to cooperate with the SRM to implement storage system management. The SRA provides
       the SRM with storage system information, including information about storage system discovery, replication LUN discovery, failover tests, and 
       disaster recovery. When the SRM creates, tests, and executes a recovery plan, the SRA immediately provides corresponding resources for the SRM
       and cooperates with the SRM to complete uninterrupted tests, site recovery automation, and migration process automation in a virtual environment.
